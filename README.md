Adaptive Concretization for Parallel Program Synthesis
======================================================

This project includes the testing infrastructure
to empirically evaluate our adaptive concretization algorithm
for parallel program synthesis.  For more details about
the algorithm and the usage of this infrastructure,
visit our github page [here][gh].
